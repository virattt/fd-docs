title: 'Beta'
openapi: 'GET /prices/beta'
---

### Overview
The Beta API returns a single market beta snapshot for a ticker using canonical defaults:

- Benchmark: `SPY` (S&P 500 proxy)
- Lookback: `5y`
- Interval: `month` (month-end)
- Price type: `adjusted_close`
- Method: OLS slope of stock returns vs benchmark returns

If a ticker has less than 5 years of history, the endpoint uses all available overlapping history.

If there are fewer than 3 overlapping monthly observations, `value` is returned as `null`.

### Available Tickers
You can fetch a list of available tickers with a `GET` request to:
https://api.financialdatasets.ai/prices/tickers/

### Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

### Example

```python Beta
import requests

headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

ticker = "AAPL"
url = f"https://api.financialdatasets.ai/prices/beta?ticker={ticker}"

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()
beta_snapshot = data["beta"]
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "beta": {
    "value": 1.18,
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "benchmark": "SPY",
    "requested_lookback": "5y",
    "interval": "month",
    "start_date": "2021-02-26",
    "end_date": "2026-01-30",
    "n_observations": 59,
    "r_squared": 0.62,
    "method": "ols",
    "price_type": "adjusted_close"
  }
}
```

### Response Fields
- `beta`: Object containing the beta calculation result.
  - `value`: Market beta (float) or `null` when data is insufficient.
  - `n_observations`: Number of overlapping monthly return points used after date alignment.
  - `r_squared`: Goodness-of-fit for the OLS relationship between stock and benchmark returns.
