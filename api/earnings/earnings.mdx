title: 'Earnings'
openapi: 'GET /earnings'
---

### Overview
The Earnings API returns the most recent earnings snapshot for a company, including:

- Key income statement fields (e.g. revenue, net income, EPS)
- Key balance sheet fields (e.g. cash, debt, assets, liabilities)
- Key cash flow fields (e.g. operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow)
- Analyst estimate comparisons when available (e.g. estimated revenue / EPS and BEAT/MISS/MEET)

The response can include both `quarterly` and `annual` data.

**Free tier**: Requests for `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `NVDA`, `TSLA`, and `GOOGL` do not require credits.

**Important**: This endpoint returns figures from a company's initial earnings release, typically filed as an 8-K with the SEC.
Because an 8-K is a preliminary snapshot, some fields may be `null` — this simply means the company did not report that figure in its initial release.
Full financial statements (income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements) are published later via 10-K and 10-Q filings and can be retrieved through our [/financials endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/financials).

### Available Tickers
You can fetch a list of available tickers with a `GET` request to:
https://api.financialdatasets.ai/earnings/tickers/

### Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add the required query param `ticker`.
3. Execute the API request.

### Example

```python Earnings
import requests

headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

ticker = "AAPL"
url = f"https://api.financialdatasets.ai/earnings?ticker={ticker}"

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()
earnings = data["earnings"]
```

### Notes
- This data is sourced from 8-K earnings releases, which are preliminary. Some fields may be `null` if not included in the initial release. For complete financials, use the [/financials endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/financials) once 10-K or 10-Q filings are published.
- `quarterly` and `annual` may be omitted when data isn't available for that time dimension.
- `fiscal_period` and `currency` may appear at the top-level when shared across `quarterly` and `annual`.
- Estimate fields (and BEAT/MISS/MEET) are returned only when analyst estimates are available.
