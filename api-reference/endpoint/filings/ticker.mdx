### Overview
The Filings endpoint allows you to fetch a list of filings for a given company.

The endpoint returns all of the filings that the company has filed with the SEC.

This includes 10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks, and more.

We have SEC filings for <b>10,000+</b> public companies.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

### Available Tickers
You can fetch a list of available tickers with a `GET` request to:
https://api.financialdatasets.ai/filings/tickers/

### Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

**Note**: You must include either the `ticker` in your query params.

### Example

```python Filings
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = 'AAPL'

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/filings'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse filings from the response
filings = response.json().get('filings')
```
