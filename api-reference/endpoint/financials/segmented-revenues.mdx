### ðŸ‘‹  Overview
The segmented revenues API provides as-reported, granular revenue data for a given stock ticker.

I finally launched the segmented revenues API, which lets your AI financial agent access segmented revenue data by product lines, business segments, and geographical regions for a given stock ticker.

This includes revenue data segmented by:
- product lines
- business segments
- geographical regions

For [example](https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/segmented-revenues/?ticker=AAPL&limit=1&period=annual), Apple Inc. reports segmented revenue for its different product lines like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and wearables.

Apple also reports segmented revenue for its different geographical regions like the Americas, Europe, and China.

The segmented revenues API lets you easily access this data in a structured format:

This data is pulled directly from XBRL filings (10-Ks and 10-Qs).  We have included the original XBRL tags like key and axis in the response for your reference.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

### ðŸ“Š Available Tickers
You can fetch a list of available tickers with a `GET` request to:
https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/segmented-revenues/tickers/

###  ðŸš€  Getting Started
There are only 3 steps for making a successful API call:
1. Add your API key to the header of the request as `X-API-KEY`.
2. Add query params like `ticker`, `period` and `limit` to filter the data.
3. Execute the API request.

You can filter the data by `ticker`, `period`, `limit`, and `cik`.

The `period` parameter can be set to `"annual"` or `"quarterly"`. The `limit` parameter is used to specify the number of statements to return.

**Note**: `ticker` and `period` are required. Alternatively, you can use `cik` instead of `ticker` as a company identifier in your request.  By default, `limit` is `4`.

### ðŸ’»  Example
```python Segmented Revenues
import requests

# add your API key to the headers
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}

# set your query params
ticker = "AAPL"     # stock ticker
period = "annual"   # possible values are "annual" or "quarterly"
limit = 5           # number of statements to return

# create the URL
url = (
    f'https://api.financialdatasets.ai/financials/segmented-revenues/'
    f'?ticker={ticker}'
    f'&period={period}'
    f'&limit={limit}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse segmented_revenues from the response
segmented_revenues = response.json().get('segmented_revenues')
```
