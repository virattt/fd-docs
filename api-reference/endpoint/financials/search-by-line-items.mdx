### Overview
This Line Items Search API lets you pull <b>specific</b> line items for a list of tickers by specifying a set of `line_items` in your request.

Line items are financial data points that are found in the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

Examples of line items are revenue, net income, total debt, free cash flow, and so on.

The purpose of this API is to let you easily get specific data points for a list of tickers in a single API request.

You can also specify a `start_date` and `end_date` to filter the line items by a specific date range.

Finally, you can specify a `period`, which must be one of `"ttm"`, `"annual"`, or `"quarterly"`.

For example, you can search for `net_income` and `total_debt` for NVDA and AAPL and receive the following response:

```json
{
  "search_results": [
    {
      "ticker": "NVDA",
      "report_period": "2024-07-28",
      "period": "ttm",
      "net_income": 53008000000,
