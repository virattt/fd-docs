### 👋  Overview
The insider transactions API lets you access the stock buys and sales of public company insiders like CEOs, CFOs, and Directors.

In addition to the stock buys and sales, you can also access the current ownership stakes of insiders.

This data is useful for understanding the sentiment of company insiders. For example, you can answer questions like:
- How many shares of Nvidia does Jensen Huang own?
- How many shares of Microsoft did Satya Nadella buy last quarter?
- How many shares of Apple has Tim Cook sold over the past year?

Any data that you receive from our API is yours to keep. You may save the data to minimize repeat API calls.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.
