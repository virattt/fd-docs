### ğŸ‘‹  Overview
The Interest Rates API lets you pull historical published interest rate data for all major central banks in the world.

We source our data directly from global central banks like the Federal Reserve, People's Bank of China, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and other major monetary authorities.  The real-time interest rate data comes from official monetary policy announcements.

To get started, please create an account and grab your <b>API key</b> at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai).

You will use the API key to authenticate your API requests.

### ğŸ“Š Available Central Banks

2. Add the `bank` parameter, which is required
3. Execute the API request.

    f'?bank={bank}'
    f'&start_date={start_date}'
    f'&end_date={end_date}'
)

# make API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# parse snapshot from the response
interest_rates = response.json().get('interest_rates')
